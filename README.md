# Jenkins Docker image built with Kubernetes support

This is a Jenkins Continuous Integration and Delivery server image for
docker with pre-installed Kubernetes plugin and Kubernetes client tools.

It is for the biggest part a copy of the [official Jenkins Docker image](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker)
but uses Fedora 22 (instead of Debian Jessie) as the originating Docker image.
